# WordDuel

[WordDuel](https://www.wordduel.xyz/) is a P2P, fully onchain game built on [Base](https://base.org/) and inspired by a popular New York Times game called [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle). The difference is that you play a friend and if you win, you'll earn some ETH.

## How do you play ?

WordDuel is a turn-based game meant to be played with two players in real-time. Each player takes a turn guessing the right word and hints are given along the way. You can learn more about the hints [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

You start by signing up with your email and depositing ETH into a wallet that's created on your behalf. To create a game or "duel", you'll declare your opponent's email and the cost for each guess. The only person who can accept the duel is the owner of the email you declared. Let's say the cost of each guess is 0.01 ETH. Each time a player makes a guess they'll have to spend 0.01 ETH. Whoever guesses the right word first, wins all the ETH that has been spent during the duel.
